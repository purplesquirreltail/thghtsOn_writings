something about the duty to document valuable experiences/knowledge - others expectations

Do I as a political activist have a duty to document and share important experiences and knowledge in terms of (mainly) writings, (but also) pictures, short movies etc. with others? 

I have been travelling for 15 months now. Before that I studied and lived a very common student life with all the long hours at the university, discussion over pizza and beers, weekly parties to relaxe from the very exhausting reality, a part-time student job and volunteering to get the oh-so-necessary working experiences to prepare myself for the afterlife at the labor market, but at the same time with a big need of escaping that runningwheel and my home country at least every 6 months and preferably for more than three weeks time.. I thing that need came from and underlying feeeling of beeing unconfortable with the whole scenery, to do something else, something different from the majority. Not something special - so many people want to be special, but the more you want to be special, the more stereotypical you become. Why? bla bla.. So no special for me, but definitely something different from the way I had lived until that day.

- something about the beginning

the recurrent (or again-and-again-asked) question: do you write about you travels/experiences?
No! No, I do not.. Why? - they ask, and look at me with disapointment and surprise in their eyes (surprise, because everybody document the tinyest change in their lifes today; disappointment, because then they will have to talk with me, they can not go online and do a quick scroll through my life for entertainment.. No, I'm not fair.. Not everybody are like this.. Only the majority..)
- the question is asked by people outside my network/environment
- why don't I?
- should I? Why? For whome? Meaning/purpose?

Beeing political
Can you be political without sharing?
